Refer to the blog https://witestlab.poly.edu/blog/adaptive-video-reproducing/ for the full version of how to run the experiement.

Step 1. Set up GENI

Creat a GENI slice with the Rspec file given in the repo.
Connect to the router and client with ssh commands.
Download/Clone necessary github repo into the nodes.
Configure the router/server/client as instructed in post. Your command should look something like this: ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_geni_ssh_rsa geni_link -p port_num
The bash scripts are also provided in the router.sh, server.sh, client.sh files to run on different nodes.


Step 2. Collect Data

Run sample command on client node: 

python2 ./AStream/dist/client/dash_client.py -m http://server/media/BigBuckBunny/4sec/BigBuckBunny_4s.mpd -p 'policy(basic/netflix/sara)' -d

Run sample command on router node:

bash rate-vary.sh ~/Dataset_1/Dataset/Ferry/Ferry5.csv 0.1


After around 5mins/longer, you can stop both node by Ctrl-C, the result of the log will be located at ASTREAM_LOGS on client's side.


Step 3. Analysis

Download the collected data and arrange them like the data folder for different policies.
The backbone code are provided, just change the directory of the data file to the right path.
