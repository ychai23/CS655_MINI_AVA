Refer to the blog https://witestlab.poly.edu/blog/adaptive-video-reproducing/ for the full version of how to run the experiement.
We also included 2 parts of video instructions on how to reproduce data collection and visualization part.

Step 1. Set up GENI

1. Creat a GENI slice with the Rspec file given in the repo. (or use our GENI slice)
2. Connect to the router and client with ssh commands.
3. Download/Clone necessary github repo into the nodes.
4. Connect and configure the router/server/client as instructed in post. Your command should look something like this: ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_geni_ssh_rsa geni_link -p port_num
5. The bash scripts are also provided in the router.sh, server.sh, client.sh files to run on different nodes. They are labeled to tell which commands you should run at different steps


Step 2. Collect Data

Run sample command on client node:
python2 ./AStream/dist/client/dash_client.py -m http://server/media/BigBuckBunny/4sec/BigBuckBunny_4s.mpd -p 'policy(basic/netflix/sara)' -d

Run sample command on router node:
bash rate-vary.sh ~/Dataset_1/Dataset/Ferry/Ferry5.csv 0.1

After around 5mins/longer, you can stop both node by Ctrl-C, the result of the log will be located at ASTREAM_LOGS on client's side.


Step 3. Analysis (refer to part2_data_analysis video)

Download the collected data and arrange them in different folders for different policies.
The backbone code are provided, just change the directory of the data file to the right path.
